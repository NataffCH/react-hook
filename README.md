# React Hooks
## project with small practical examples of how to use react hooks

Project created to practice the concepts of react hooks at all stages and in detail.<br/>
I left the steps commented out so the app doesn't break.<br/>
With each new commit, I will test a different concept.<br/>
Its simplier examples.<br/>
If you are looking for more didactic usage examples (this repository is for personal study only,I will not provide clear explanations)<br/>
I suggest studying through this site, which has very complete examples to study hooks:<br/>

### [useHooks](https://usehooks.com/)

This website provides easy to understand code examples to help you learn how hooks work and inspire you to take advantage of them in your next project.

### tip:
Try testing these examples in the [code sandbox](https://codesandbox.io/s/new?utm_source=dotnew) as the project is small and the examples are short.

### run project locally
npm start
