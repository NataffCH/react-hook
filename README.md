# ReactHooks
## project with emphasis on the use of react hooks.

Project created to practice the concepts of react hooks at all stages and in detail.<br/>
I left the steps commented out so the app doesn't break.<br/>
With each new commit, I will test a different concept.<br/>

- [array and object destructuring](https://github.com/Jeefelix/ReactHooks/commit/94e5c1bdaa197fd2092499f882052ed430691226)
